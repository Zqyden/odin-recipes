# Odin Recipes

This repository of recipes is to demonstrate the HTML skills I have learned from going through the odin's circulium. 

To name a few HTML skils. The use of a tags and other paragraphing tags such as the p and h1-h6 tags to provide visuals to the internet of several recipes. As well as, the img tag to display the final recipes.
